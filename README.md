# React Shopping Cart

Create a shopping cart in react by using react hooks. We use Context and Reducer to manage the component state.
## Prerequisite
To understand the code properly you must have the basic knowledge of react hooks.

## Installation

First, download and install the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
 on your server.

Then check the version of Node.js and npm by running using the following command on cmd.
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

After that open cmd in any folder and run the following command to create react app in that folder.
```bash
npx create-react-app react-shopping-cart
cd react-shopping-cart
``` 
After that use 'npm start' command to run the app
```bash
npm start
``` 


## Dependencies
We use the bootstrap library to make the application UI.

Install bootstrap package
```bash
npm install bootstrap
``` 
After that import the following bootstrap into your App.js file to use bootstrap classes.
```bash
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
``` 
We use [Fake store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to get dummy products for the app.
